# PHP Boilerplate

Welcome to the PHP Boilerplate - a powerful library that helps you build fast,
robust, adaptable, and scalable websites. Spend more time developing, and less
time reinventing the wheel.

This project pulls from all over the internet, and consists of many years of
iterative development and combined community knowledge. It does not impose a
specific development philosophy or architecture, so you're free to develop the
way you want.
